# Guessing Game

This program will continuously ask the user to guess the number of files in the current directory, until they guess the correct number. The user will be informed if their guess is too high or too low. Once the user guesses the correct number of files in the current directory they should be congratulated.

The makefile should produce the README.md which should contain the following information:
* The title of the project. 
* The date and time at which make was run.
* The number of lines of code contained in guessinggame.sh.

## Prerequisite

Make sure you are running **Bash shell**

## Usage Example

```
$ bash guessinggame.sh

1

6

4

congrats, you nailed it!
```
